    "- Identity block: Residual connection is input as is\n",
    "- Convolution block: If the input/output sizes don't match, we apply convolution on the residual connection first and then add it! We also apply batch norm on the residual connection after conv2d and then add it to the output of the last output of the block before ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ResNet \"convolutional block\" is the second block type. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path.\n",
